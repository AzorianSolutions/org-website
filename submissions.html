                        with the client to mutate their existing templates into my format.</p>

                            used to match your customer subscriptions to service plans. Whether that's a numeric index
                            or an ASCII label, just about anything works so long as it's unique across your service plan
                            data.</p>

                            service plan. It is not currently used by the process but could be used in the future for
                            summary reports. In many cases, this field may have an identical value to AUX_PLAN_ID.</p>
                        <p><strong>TYPE</strong>: <br/>This field is used to indicate what account types may
                            consume this service plan. A value of &quot;R&quot; should be used for residential only
                            plans, &quot;B&quot; should be used for business / commercial only plans, and &quot;X&quot;

                            technology to indicate here. A value of &quot;50&quot; should be used for optical
                            connections as well as copper Ethernet connections fed by optical trunks. A value of &quot;70&quot;
                            should be used for unlicensed FWLL such as 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. A value of &quot;71&quot;
                            should be used for fully licensed FWLL such as 2.5 GHz and 3 GHz PAL holders. A value of
                            &quot;72&quot; should be used for lightly licensed FWLL such as 3 GHz CBRS GAA users.</p>
                        <p><strong>TECH_CODES</strong>: <br/>This field can be used in place of the aforementioned

                        okay to report the same address twice in the subscription file, and it will be counted
                        automatically. See below for a description of fields that should be present in the CSV file.</p>
                    <p>If your OSS is unable to provide a service plan association in the data export, then you may also
                        use the DL_* and UL_* fields below to define throughput information which will then be used to
                        match a plan based on defined limits. If you have a scenario more complicate than this, make
                        sure to reach out to me. My system supports more variations than what is documented here.</p>

                    <p>Coverage models are ultimately converted to Shapefile format for use in my system. If you can
                        provide your coverage in that directly, great. If not, I have a tool that can convert many other
                        formats such as KML, KMZ, and geoJSON.</p>
                    <p><strong>REMEMBER!</strong> Just because a piece of software creates a KML/KMZ file, that does
                        <strong>not</strong> mean that the file actually contains valid coverage data! Modern versions
                        of software such as UISP / ISP Design will create KML files that contain embedded images of a
                        coverage map. This is not an acceptable format for conversion as the coverage must actually be
                        defined as polygon data.</p>
                    <p>A polygon will be an array of three or more sets of geographic coordinates that define a
                        containing area when all sequentially connected. If you want something to compare your export
                        to, open Google Earth and draw a polygon shape over a map and then export that file as KML. This
                        is a good example of what polygon data looks like.</p>
                    <p>If you use TowerCoverage or cnHeat, both of those products provide direct exports in the formats
                        needed.</p>
                    <p>If you provide connectivity via hardline such as optical or copper, then you need to provide
                        coverage data indicating every home that can be connected through the use of containment
                        polygons. Many popular fiber planning tools should be able to provide an export for this.</p>

						<h3>Location Fabric Data</h3>
						<p>This data set is <strong>only required if you require BDC submission processing</strong> services from me.</p>
						<p>Your location fabric data is something that you must obtain from CostQuest. This is a fairly simple but tedious process to obtain the data.</p>
						<p>Your first step if you haven't already, is to get registered for a support account with CostQuest. Begin by sending an email to <a href="mailto:nbfsupport@costquest.com">nbfsupport@costquest.com</a> with a simple request to setup a tier 2 location fabric license.</p>
						<p>CostQuest will guide you the rest of the way through the process on obtaining the data. Once you complete this step, CostQuest will provide a download link to a Zip archive. Please provide me with that download link <strong>and not a copy of the extracted files!</strong></p>
